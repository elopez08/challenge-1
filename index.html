<!--

    Summary of the code:  There are a few changes that need to be made here in the HTML to have it cleanly structured.  Here's what is noted:
    1. The code is filled with divs.  Even though it does work, this is going to be a headache for another developer to follow.  For each
    section(s), I've decided to change the name for a SEMANTIC element such as Header, Section, etc.
    2. The title of the website was changed
    3. Each picture has an "alt" attribute.  If the web fails to load the image, there will be a message there instead
    4. On the Aside section, there was a change on the format with h3.  It is changed to h2 for consistancy

    Most of the coding works as intended.  This is to make it a bit neater.  The majority of the changes of the structure will be found in the .css file

        There are more changes that we need to make.  There are "div"s, but some of them can be applied as "section" instead.  On the main ones, I'm going to change them to "section".  
        I'll write a comment on what part are we changing. 
        One more thing:  Inside this section has an alt as well.  If the picture can't be loaded from the css, then it'll show as an alt message instead

            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

                We'll use that instead of h3 that is on this 
                One thing, too:  There are three icons here that need to have an alt in case the image can't be loaded.
